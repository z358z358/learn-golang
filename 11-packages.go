/*
Why do we use packages?
reuse function

What is the difference between an identifier that starts with a capital letter and one which doesnâ€™t? (Average vs average)
means other packages (and programs) are able to see it

What is a package alias? How do you make one?
rename the imported package, import f "fmt"

How would you document the functions you created in #3?
Executing: godoc golang-book/chapter11/math Min and godoc golang-book/chapter11/math Max
