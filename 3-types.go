How are integers stored on a computer?
http://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/3#section1

We know that (in base 10) the largest 1 digit number is 9 and the largest 2 digit number is 99. Given that in binary the largest 2 digit number is 11 (3), the largest 3 digit number is 111 (7) and the largest 4 digit number is 1111 (15) what's the largest 8 digit number? (hint: 101-1 = 9 and 102-1 = 99)
255

What's the value of the expression (true && false) || (false && true) || !(false && false)?

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Although overpowered for the task you can use Go as a calculator. Write a program that computes 32132 Ã— 42452 and prints it to the terminal. (Use the * operator for multiplication)
	fmt.Println(32132 * 42452)

	// What is a string? How do you find its length?
	// http://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/3#section2
	x := "test"
	fmt.Println(len(x))

	fmt.Println((true && false) || (false && true) || !(false && false))
}
